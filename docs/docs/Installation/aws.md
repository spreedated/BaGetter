# Run BaGetter on AWS

:::warning

This page is a work in progress!

:::

Use Amazon Web Services to scale BaGetter. You can store metadata on [Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)](https://aws.amazon.com/rds) and upload packages to [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) or any other S3-compatible service.

## Configure BaGetter

You can modify BaGetter's configurations by editing the `appsettings.json` file. For the full list of configurations, please refer to [BaGetter's configuration](../configuration.md) guide.

### Amazon S3

Create a bucket, a service account with access to the bucket, and an access key for the service account.  
Update the `appsettings.json` file with those:

```json
{
    ...

    "Storage": {
        "Type": "AwsS3",
        "Region": "us-west-1",
        "Bucket": "foo",
        "AccessKey": "",
        "SecretKey": ""
    },

    ...
}
```

#### S3-compatible object storage

You can use any other S3-compatible storage service, as long as it's compatible with Amazon AWS S3. Since the URL for services other than Amazon AWS will change, you need to provide this Service URL instead of the Region. For example:

```json
{
    ...

    "Storage": {
        "Type": "AwsS3",
        "Endpoint": "https://eu-central-1.linodeobjects.com",
        "Bucket": "nuget-packages",
        "AccessKey": "",
        "SecretKey": ""
    },

    ...
}
```

Note: to avoid errors, only one of `Region` or `Endpoint` setting can be set at the same time.

#### Known compatible services

So far, it has been tested in [Linodeâ€™s Object Storage](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/storage/object-storage/). If you succeed in using other storage service, let us know so we can state it here.


### Amazon RDS

<Tabs groupId="database-types">
  <TabItem value="postgresql" label="Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL">
To use [PostgreSQL](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql), update the `appsettings.json` file:

```json
{
    ...

    "Database": {
        "Type": "PostgreSql",
        "ConnectionString": "..."
    },

    ...
}
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="mysql" label="Amazon RDS for MySQL">
To use [MySQL](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/mysql), update the `appsettings.json` file:

```json
{
    ...

    "Database": {
        "Type": "MySql",
        "ConnectionString": "..."
    },

    ...
}
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="sqlserver" label="Amazon RDS for SQL Server">
To use [SQL Server](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/sqlserver), update the `appsettings.json` file:

```json
{
    ...

    "Database": {
        "Type": "SqlServer",
        "ConnectionString": "..."
    },

    ...
}
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Publish packages

Publish your first package with:

```shell
dotnet nuget push -s http://localhost:5000/v3/index.json package.1.0.0.nupkg
```

Publish your first [symbol package](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/create-packages/symbol-packages-snupkg) with:

```shell
dotnet nuget push -s http://localhost:5000/v3/index.json symbol.package.1.0.0.snupkg
```

:::warning

You should secure your server by requiring an API Key to publish packages. For more information, please refer to the [Require an API Key](../configuration.md#require-an-api-key) guide.

## Restore packages

You can restore packages by using the following package source:

`http://localhost:5000/v3/index.json`

Some helpful guides:

- [Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/install-use-packages-visual-studio#package-sources)
- [NuGet.config](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/nuget-config-file#package-source-sections)

## Symbol server

You can load symbols by using the following symbol location:

`http://localhost:5000/api/download/symbols`

For Visual Studio, please refer to the [Configure Debugging](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/specify-symbol-dot-pdb-and-source-files-in-the-visual-studio-debugger?view=vs-2017#configure-symbol-locations-and-loading-options) guide.
